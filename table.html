    <td>Horns allow for a powerful charge attack</td>
    <td>Not much diversity in their attack pattern, as well as them preferring not to fight</td>
    <td>First off, I'm not afraid of the goats horns, I say bring it, and the goat charges head on at me. What do I do? Charge back. Fight fire with fire. It's a clash of who can do the most damage but little does the goat now, I have hands, and I fight dirty, I grab the goat by the horns flip it over me slamming it into the ground. K.O.</td>

    <td>Short sighted and poor peripheral vision</td>
    <td>I'm playing the stealth games, gotta stalk my prey in silence like a ninja, ya feel me? I wait pateintly for the bear to lower it's gaurd and then rush in with light footwork attacking from behind. This is bare combat against a bear, so I don't have tools or anything. I grab the bear in a deadlock to choke it out. Uh oh, neck to thick. The bear goes all jungle book on me and backs slams his back into a tree. I'm stunned, Bear has strategy. I let go and we both enter a standoff. Who's gonna makes the first move, we pondered. I go in for a dash attack and with all my might, land a solid punch aimed for it's gut. The bear blocked it. It says to me "is that all you got, kid?" in bear language, I tell him "I'm just getting started" and then we have dramatic combat.</td>

    <td>We are fighting in a jungle setting, Gorilla is chasing me down. I'm at a disadvantage but I won't just give up. I look around the jungle for one item in particular, Banana. I spot said banana, and quickly get to it whilst being chased by the gorilla. I grab banana, gorilla right behind me, I stop running open my arms wide and embrace big monkey. I love monkeys. I give the gorilla the banana, and then we hang out for a while. It plays it's bongos and fall asleep star gazing.</td>
